# Constrained Path Integral Optimal Control

Path integral methods have been an important tool for systems with stochastic continuous dynamics. Recent work mainly focuses on unconstrained control problems while I investigated how to deal with systems constrained by state-input inequality. Details are explained in my report (which I cannot make public now) and the algorithm is implemented in both MATLAB and C++ (currently working on).

## Usage

To test 1-DoF simulation, run runDoubleSlitExample.m in the folder "Double Slit Example 1D".

To test 2-DoF simulation, run runSimulation.m in the folder "Double Slit Example 2D".

The parameters are stored in the file "paramDoubleSlit.mat".
