# Path Integral Control

Path integral control methods are implemented in this project for both unconstrained and state-input-inequality-constrained cases.

## Usage

To test 1-DoF simulation, run runDoubleSlitExample.m in the folder "Double Slit Example 1D".

To test 2-DoF simulation, run runSimulation.m in the folder "Double Slit Example 2D".

The parameters are stored in the file "paramDoubleSlit.mat".

## Acknowledgement

I finished this project under the supervision of Jan Carius and Dr. Farbod Farshidian, without whose help I cannot make it.
