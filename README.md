# Constrained Path Integral Optimal Control

Path integral methods have been an important tool for systems with stochastic continuous dynamics. Recent work mainly focuses on unconstrained control problems while I investigated how to deal with systems constrained by state-input inequality. Details are explained in `Final Report` under `doc` directory and the path integral algorithms are implemented in MATLAB, which can be found under `src`.

## Usage

- To test 1-DoF simulation, run `runDoubleSlitExample.m` in the folder `Double Slit Example 1D`

- To test 2-DoF simulation, run `runSimulation.m` in the folder `Double Slit Example 2D`

- The parameters are stored in the file `paramDoubleSlit.mat`
